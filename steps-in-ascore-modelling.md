# Developing Application Scorecard Using Logistic Regression Model
Developing an A-score with logistic regression model involves numerous manual steps, as logistic regression does not inherently handle categorical features, lacks feature interaction, and can accommodate fewer features compared to more advanced models like gradient boosted trees. This section explains the process of building a predictive model using logistic regression, and subsequently converting it into a scorecard.

The steps to develop an A-score using logistic regression model are outlined as follows:

1. Target label creation.
2. Feature engineering.
3. Manual feature interraction.
4. Data Splitting
5. Feature transformation using Weight of Evidence (WoE).
6. Identify the most impactful features to include in the model (feature selection).
7. Model taining and hyperparameter tuning.
8. Evaluation.
9. Scorecard Creation.

Each of these steps is crucial for effectively leveraging logistic regression in predictive modeling, ensuring that the final model is both accurate and practical.
